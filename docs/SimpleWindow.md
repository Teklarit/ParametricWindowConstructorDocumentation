# Simple Windows and Doors

`PWCSimpleWindow` Ð¸ `PWCSimpleDoor` - classes for quick construction of simple windows and doors. Filling restrictions: from 1 to 3 rows (vertical filling) with different filling coefficients. Then in each row an arbitrary number of cells with glass or sash (horizontal filling).

> The difference between `PWCSimpleWindow` and `PWCSimpleDoor`: in `PWCSimpleWindow` we configure the filling in the frame, in `PWCSimpleDoor` we configure the filling in the main sash.

- `Main Door Data`: (only for `PWCSimpleDoor`)
	- `Sash Side` - Sash side.
	- `Open Angle Type` - Set the type and angle of opening (used for the current display, for converting in the desired form into a single mesh).
	- `Angle Left Right` - Set the current angle of opening to the side. (0 - 120, degrees).
	- `Angle Up Down` - Set the current angle of opening down. (0 - 10, degrees).
- `Filling`
	-  `Override Materials` - On/off the list of materials that will be applied to the geometry of the structure instead of the base materials.
	- `Width` - The width of the structure.
	- `Height` - The height of the structure.
	- `Rows Count` - The number of rows in the structure. From 1 to 3. (vertical filling).
	- `Row Weight` - Fill factor (The higher the value, the greater the ratio of the cell height to the total height).
	- `Row Filling` - Array with data that will fill the row (horizontal filling).
		- `Filling Type` - Cell type (glass, sash).
		- `Fill Weight` - Cell fill factor in a row.
		- `Glazing Type` - Glazing type (triple glazing, opaque panel)
		- `Sash Side` - Sash side.
		- `Open Angle Type` - Set the type and angle of opening (used for the current display, for converting in the desired form into a single mesh).
		- `Angle Left Right` - Set the current angle of opening to the side. (0 - 120, degrees).
		- `Angle Up Down` - Set the current angle of opening down. (0 - 10, degrees).
		
> Some fields are hidden/showed depending on the type of filling and other dependent data.

### Sill

- `Sill`
	- `Add Sill` - On/off window sill.
	- `Sill Depth` - Window sill depth (cm).
	- `Sill Extra Width` - Additional window sill width (cm) (+ or - to the width of the construction).
	- `Sill Origin Right Offset` - Move window sill right/left (+/-) (If `Sill Extra Width` = 20, then `Sill Origin Right Offset` = 10 or -10 (half) to align to the desired side).
